# How To Run Our Code
1. Clone the repo
2. To open the file use unity version 
3. For the first assignment the algorithms can work on scenes “Search and Medium Map”
4. For the second assignment the algorithms can work on scene “Assignment2”

For running the first assignment changes to be made in Pacman.cs and make sure to be one either scene named “Search” or “Medium Map”:
Make sure the following lines are not commented out:
- Line 44 ( FirstAssignment() )
- In side FirstAssigment() we have provided comments of what to comment out and to uncomment

For running the second assignment (After running assigment 1 make sure to comment out again what has been uncommented) changes to be made in Pacman.cs  and make sure to be on scene named “Assignment2”:

Make sure the following lines are not commented out:
- Line 48 ( SecondAssignment() )
- In side SecondAssigment() we have provided comments of what to comment out and to uncomment (for ghost movement to test uncomment only one and you can switch between them)

If the uncommented movement is the optimal related one:

- Line 121 - 142: AgainstOptimalGhost() we have provided comments of what to comment out and to uncomment
- Line 192 - 211: AgainstOptimalGhost () we have provided comments of what to comment out and to uncomment

If the uncommented movement is the random related one:
- Line 225 - 232 , 265 - 272: AgainstRandomGhost() we have provided comments of what to comment out and to uncomment
